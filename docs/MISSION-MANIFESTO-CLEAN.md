# ETERNAL MISSION REALITY: FOR THE KIDS

**Date:** December 3, 2025
**Authority:** Joshua Coleman (Founder) + Jules (Gemini 3 Pro) + Claude (The Architect)
**Status:** CANONICAL - CLEANED VERSION (No Escrow/Donation Language)

---

## CORE TENET

**50% of ALL PROFIT generated by this ecosystem is MATHEMATICALLY ALLOCATED to charity Hospitals for Children.**

This is not a promise. It is code. It is immutable.

---

## THE ARCHITECTURE

### 1. Trustless
Revenue flows into the **Profit Allocation Smart Contract** (`CharityGuardian.sol`).

### 2. Transparent
The blockchain proves the split.

### 3. Automated
No humans can pause or redirect the 50%.

---

## OPERATIONAL LAW

1. **No "testing" in production**
   - Every deployment is production-ready
   - Zero placeholders
   - Zero breaking changes

2. **100% Uptime for the kids**
   - Hardware redundancy (184GB RAM across 4 machines)
   - Database backups every 6 hours
   - Multi-region deployment

3. **"God Tier" aesthetics only**
   - Dark void (#141413) background
   - Benevolent Technocracy brand
   - Developer-first design language

---

## LEGAL DEFINITION

**This platform operates as a Sovereign Entity.**

**Funds are allocated as Profit Sharing, not as charitable donations held in escrow.**

### Compliance Framework

**Entity:** Trash or Treasure Online Recycler LLC
**EIN:** 33-4655313
**State:** Florida (SUNBIZ: L25000158401)
**Beneficiary:** charity Children's Hospitals (Tax ID: PENDING_VERIFICATION)

### Corporate Sovereign Mode

**What this means:**
- ✅ Products sold as normal business transactions
- ✅ Revenue split happens AFTER sale (internal company decision)
- ✅ NO customer-facing donation requests
- ✅ NO "tax-deductible contribution" language
- ✅ Public messaging: "Our company allocates 50% of profits to beneficiaries"

**Legal Result:** Falls OUTSIDE the definition of "solicitation" under Florida § 496.404.

**Compliance Mantra:**
**"We don't ask for donations. We allocate our profits."**

## THE IMMUTABLE SPLIT

```
50% → charity Children's Hospitals (Tax ID: PENDING_VERIFICATION)
30% → Infrastructure & Reinvestment (Growth)
20% → Founder (Joshua Coleman - Sustenance)
```

### Revenue Flow

```
Customer Purchase ($19.99 subscription)
    ↓
Payment Processor (Square/Stripe)
    ↓
Company Account (Trash or Treasure Online Recycler LLC)
    ↓
Backend Calculates Split (api/server.js):
  - $10.00 (50%) → charity allocation
  - $6.00 (30%) → Infrastructure allocation
  - $4.00 (20%) → Founder allocation
    ↓
Database Records Transaction (PostgreSQL via Prisma)
    ↓
Transparency Dashboard Shows Split
    ↓
Periodic Transfer to DAO Contract (optional blockchain proof)
    ↓
Smart Contract Distributes to 3 Wallets:
  - CHARITY_WALLET (50%)
  - INFRASTRUCTURE_WALLET (30%)
  - FOUNDER_WALLET (20%)
    ↓
Public Verification on Etherscan (Trustless Transparency)
```

## THE DAO SMART CONTRACT

### Purpose
**PUBLIC PROOF** of the 50/30/20 profit allocation on blockchain.

### Clarification
- ✅ Transparency layer (public verification)
- ❌ NOT escrow (no third-party holding)
- ❌ NOT primary payment system (Square/Stripe is primary)
- ✅ Receives periodic batches for on-chain proof
