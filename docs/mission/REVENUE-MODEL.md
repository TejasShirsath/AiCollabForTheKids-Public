## 🔄 How It Works

### The Original 50/30/20 Project
- Original project has operational costs built in
- 50% goes to charity Children's Hospital
- 30% covers infrastructure for ALL future projects
- 20% compensates Joshua Coleman

### Original Project Supports All New Projects
- Original project generates revenue with 50/30/20 split
- The 30% infrastructure portion covers:
  - Grok AI API costs for ALL new 100% projects
  - Claude AI API costs for ALL new 100% projects  
  - Electricity for servers running ALL new 100% projects
  - Hardware maintenance for ALL new 100% projects
- This allows ALL NEW projects to be truly 100% charity

### Example Calculation
**Original Project:** Receives $1,000 in donations
- $500 (50%) → charity Children's Hospital
- $300 (30%) → Infrastructure (pays for AI/electricity for new 100% projects)
- $200 (20%) → Joshua Coleman

**New Project:** Receives $1,000 in revenue
- $1,000 (100%) → Charity
- $0 deducted for operations

## 💡 Why This Model?

2. **Maximum Charity Impact:** ALL new projects are 100% charity with zero deductions
3. **Transparent Allocation:** Clear breakdown of where every dollar goes
4. **Scalability:** Original 30% infrastructure funding enables unlimited 100% charity projects
