## 💡 THE PROBLEM

**Dating apps aren't designed to get you off the app.**

They're designed to keep you swiping.

- ❌ AI algorithms optimize for engagement, not relationships
- ❌ Bots and catfish ruin the experience
- ❌ Endless swiping, zero connections
- ❌ Your data sold to advertisers

**We said: Enough.**

---

## ✅ THE SOLUTION

**YouAndINotAI: Dating for humans, by humans.**

### What Makes Us Different:

#### 🚫 Zero AI Matchmaking

## 👤 WHO'S BUILDING THIS?

**Hi, I'm Josh Coleman.**

- 28 years building automation systems
- 18 years at eBay (built charity integrations for charity, St. Jude's)
- Retired at 30 to build platforms that matter

**I know AI. I love AI. But dating? Humans should decide.**

After watching dating apps become engagement engines—designed to keep you swiping, not connecting—I built the opposite.

**YouAndINotAI: Real people. Real connections. Zero algorithms.**

## 📊 THE REVENUE MODEL (Full Transparency)

**We're not VC-backed. We're mission-backed.**

### Revenue Split:
- **50%** → Escrow Vault (Reserved for charity Children's Hospitals)
- **30%** → Infrastructure (servers, AI tools, scaling)
- **20%** → Joshua Coleman (founder compensation)

**Why?** Because I can't take it with me. Tomorrow isn't promised for any human. This platform will help kids for **50 years after I die.**

**That's the mission.** 💙

## 💬 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### **How does "zero AI matchmaking" work?**
You browse profiles. You filter by location, age, interests. You message people YOU choose. No algorithm deciding "compatibility scores." No endless swiping. Just real people.

### **How do you verify profiles without AI?**
Manual verification. Real humans review every profile. Photo verification (selfie with unique code). Phone verification. We take the time to do it right.

### **What if I don't find anyone?**
That's the point. If dating apps worked, you'd delete the app. We're not optimizing for engagement. We're optimizing for real connections. If you find someone, we WANT you to leave.

### **Why 50% to charity?**
Because profit without purpose is pointless. This isn't about getting rich. It's about building a platform that helps kids long after I'm gone. That's the legacy.

### **Can I cancel anytime?**
Yes. No long-term contracts. Cancel anytime. We're confident you'll stay because the platform works, not because we trapped you.

### **What platforms do you support?**
Web (desktop + mobile browser). Native iOS and Android apps coming Q2 2026 (Founding Members get early access).
