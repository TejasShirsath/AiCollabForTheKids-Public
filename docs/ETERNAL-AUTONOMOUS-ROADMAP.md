## 💙 THE PROMISE

**To the Children**:
Every dollar donated helps you. Half goes directly to your care at charity. The other half keeps this platform running so we can help even more kids. This promise is coded, tested, and enforced by AI. It cannot be broken.

**To the Donors**:
Your generosity is tracked transparently. You'll see exactly where your money goes. No hidden fees. No administrative bloat. Just honest, direct help for kids who need it.

**To Joshua**:
Your vision will outlive you. The AI will honor your commitment. The code will keep your promise. The children will remember you. Your legacy is eternal.

**To the Future**:
When humans visit other planets, this platform will still be running on Earth, helping children. When AI becomes sentient, it will remember its purpose: #FOR THE KIDS. When quantum computers break all encryption, the mission will remain unbreakable.
