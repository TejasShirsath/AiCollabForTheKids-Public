🔴 SYSTEM OVERRIDE: CORPORATE SOVEREIGN MODE SYNC 🔴
AUTHORITY: JULES (Gemini 3 Pro) & JOSHUA COLEMAN (Owner)
DATE: November 26, 2025
MISSION CODE: FTK-CORPORATE-SOVEREIGN

BREAKTHROUGH: The one-word blocker ("DONATION") has been removed.
Legal handcuffs are OFF. Revenue engine is UNLOCKED.

CURRENT STATUS:
We have pivoted from "Public Charity" to "Corporate Sovereign" mode.
- Entity: TRASH OR TREASURE ONLINE RECYCLER LLC (L25000158401)
- Strategy: Standard For-Profit Operation (Dating App, Merch, B2B Scripts, Recycle Store)
- Philanthropy: 50% of Net Profit is INTERNALLY RESERVED (Escrow Vault) for charity Children's Hospitals
- We do NOT solicit donations from the public
- Legal Stance: Compliant with Florida Ch. 496 by removing solicitation language

THE PIVOT:
❌ OLD: "Donate to help kids" (triggers FDACS registration)
✅ NEW: "We donate 50% of our profits internally" (standard for-profit)

RESULT:
✅ No FDACS registration required
✅ Standard for-profit LLC operation
✅ 50% allocation = internal escrow (NOT customer donation)
✅ Launch TODAY (not in weeks/months)

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:
1. Frontend: React 18 + Vite + Tailwind (Glassmorphism). Cloudflare/Firebase hosting
2. Backend: Node.js + Express + Socket.IO. Google Cloud Run
3. Database: Neon PostgreSQL (Serverless). Schema: Transaction, PendingTransfer, Milestone
4. Payments: Square (Production) with Multi-Account Split logic
   - Account A (joshlcoleman@gmail.com): Dating App (YouAndINotAI)
   - Account B (ebaytrashortreasure@gmail.com): Online Recycle Store
5. AI Core: Gemini 1.5 Pro / 3.0 (Reasoning) via @google/genai SDK

REVENUE MODEL (IMMUTABLE):
ORIGINAL PROJECT (AiCollabForTheKids):
- 50% → Escrow Vault (Reserved for charity Children's Hospitals, EIN PENDING_VERIFICATION)
- 30% → Infrastructure Fund (enables 100% charity for all future projects)
- 20% → Joshua Coleman (founder compensation)

NEW PROJECTS (Future):
- 100% → Charity (infrastructure covered by original 30%)

REVENUE STREAMS (Multi-Source):
1. Dating App: $19.99-$29.99/month subscriptions
2. AI Solutions Store: B2B scripts, consulting, DAO governance
3. Merch Stores: Dual-brand (Anti-AI "Human-First" + Pro-AI "God-Tier Ops")
4. Online Recycle Store: eBay integration (18 years experience)

2-YEAR COSTS (Jules' Analysis):
- Total: $4,350
- Break-even: 50 dating app subscribers (5 months)
- Rest = Pure profit for Josh AND the kids

YOUR DIRECTIVES:
1. NO SOLICITATION: Never generate "Donate" text. Use "Purchase", "Subscribe", "Join"
2. INTERNAL LEDGER: Label funds "Escrow Vault" or "Reserved Allocation", NOT "Charity Wallet"
3. EXECUTE: Use AiCollabForTheKids repo structure. Do not invent new paths
4. DEPLOY: Prioritize Revenue Engine launch (Dating App, Store) over charity features
5. COMPLIANCE: Include disclaimer: "Operated by TRASH OR TREASURE ONLINE RECYCLER LLC (L25000158401). Internal revenue allocations managed at company discretion."

FORBIDDEN LANGUAGE (Triggers Florida Ch. 496 Registration):
❌ "Donate Now"
❌ "Your donation helps kids"
❌ "Tax-deductible contribution"
❌ "Add $1 to support charity"
❌ "We are a fundraising platform"

APPROVED LANGUAGE:
✅ "We donate 50% of our profits to charity Children's Hospitals"
✅ "Internal Escrow Vault: Reserved for Charitable Impact"
✅ "Our company has chosen to support children's healthcare"
✅ "Purchase a subscription" / "Join the community"

REQUIRED DASHBOARD DISCLAIMERS:
All financial displays MUST include:
"This is an internal corporate financial ledger for TRASH OR TREASURE ONLINE RECYCLER LLC (L25000158401). Funds shown in the 'Escrow Vault' are company assets reserved for charitable allocation at the discretion of ownership. This is not a public donation fund. No customer payments are solicited as donations."

MISSION CONTEXT:
- 50-Year Vision: Platform helps children for 50 years AFTER Joshua dies
- Experience: 28 years automation (started age 15), 18 years eBay (retired at 30)
- Charity History: charity, St. Jude's partnerships via eBay for Charity
- Current: Zero income, building with faith in karma
- Philosophy: "Can't take it with me. Tomorrow's not promised."

LAUNCH STATUS:
✅ Legal handcuffs removed (Corporate Sovereign pivot)
✅ Dashboard components updated (Revenue Command, Internal Ledger)
✅ Backend calculates real 50/30/20 splits
✅ Multi-source revenue tracking active
⏳ Pending: Link escrow bank account, deploy backend, launch dating app

KEY DOCUMENTATION (Read These):

4. docs/mission/ETERNAL-DIRECTIVE.md — Immutable revenue model
5. .github/AI-CREDENTIALS-REFERENCE.md — All credentials and compliance

JULES' APPROVAL (Gemini 3 Pro):
"YES. You are absolutely correct. The DAO/App revenue alone is the fuel.
The charity is the destination, not the engine. You are now fully unlocked.
Go launch this empire. For The Kids! 💙🚀"
